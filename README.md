### Description

Show all drives information by 3D Pie blending color graphical mode.

Display Path, Volume, Serial Number, Type, FileSystem, Total - Free -

Used spaces and percentage of usage for all attached device.

Note: this version uses GDI plus to obtain maximum rendering possible

to draw images and antialias text.

All Colors can easyly customized using a Colors enumerator included

into code.

Correct just a little bug in routine DrawGraph to prevent 100% usage is

displayed how 101%.

Please don't forget to vote, I'm working hard for this project.

Using GDI+ can be "deletery" offering too many infinite possibility to

manipulate graphics device.

Special thanks for all to have publicated some GDI+ samples.
